#Hotdog Not Hotdog (Inspired by Silicon Valley)
##About
This project is my attempt at replicating Silicon Valley's SeeFood App  
I used [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACmydtFDTGs) as my guiding principle and used [this research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.00983.pdf) as a baseline for making modifications and tweaks. I ended up using a 5-layer CNN to determine if an image contained a hotdog.

My resulting model reached 97% test accuracy.
